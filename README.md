# Nintendo Switch Theme for EmulationStation on smaller displays (480x320, 640x480, and 854x480)
Over the last few days I have been working on this theme further. I updated all the icons a few days ago and decided to update the rest of the theme.

Big Screen version can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dJp0853Fvu9UHS1tP2YIZBIfvChuaZh/view?usp=sharing)

System View - Light and Dark
